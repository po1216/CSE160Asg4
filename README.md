### Objective:
To have a single point light that illuminates the objects in the world.

### Descriptions:
- Specular lighting is applied to the ball (sphere) in the center. For every other object, only diffuse and ambient lights are applied on purpose to see if specular lighting is working correctly (since it is easy to tell on spheres).
- There is a button to visualize normals with color.
- There is a button  to turn on and off lighting.
- You can change color of diffuse and ambient light using the color picker.
- There is a button to move the light around. If you want to adjust its location, turn off the animation and use the sliders. The bright yellow cube is the visual marker of light location.
- No spot light is added.
